## README

The task was to create the four plots given in the *figure* folder using
the base plotting system of R. See *task description.md* for more
details.

The original data set was *houshold_power_consumption.txt*, which can be
downloaded from
<https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip>.

The code for creating the four plots can be found in *plot1.R*, ...,
*plot4.R*, respectively.\
These files also use *preprocessing.R*, which loads the data set and
makes the data frame tidy.\
In order to run the code, the working directory has to be the projects
repository and the file *houshold_power_consumption.txt* has to be
placed in the repository.

Last but not least, the four produced plots can be found in *plot1.png*,
..., *plot4.png*, respectively.
